		<procedure>
			<step>cli before preparation.</step>
			<step>Prepare kernel stack, just use value stored in esp.</step>
			<step>Prepare GDT, the address of gdt is new,
				we use a global value defined in "include/global.c".
				But the first 4 descriptors are similar to before,
				and new descrptors could be added below them.</step>
			<step>Prepare IDT, the contents of idt won't be set yet.</step>
			<step>Initialize the 8259A chip.</step>
			<step>Initialize the exception, for each exception,
				add its gate to idt.</step>
			<step>Initialize 16 maskable interruption include clock,
				keyboard and so on. </step>
			<step>Prepare TSS.</step>
			<step>Prepare LDT, it is 6th descriptor in GDT.
				And our simple process will use it.</step>
			<step>load gdt, idt, tss which we have prepared.</step>
			<step>Jump to main procedure of kernle, finally we can code with C.</step>
		</procedure>

	<sect1><title>Main Procedure of Kernel</title>
		<step>Prepare table of process.</step>
		<step>Run our first process, it is totally another story...</step>
		<step>Loop, never exit.</step>

	<sect1><title>Interrupt Happens While Process Running</title>
		<para>Our process is running at level 1,
			so when interrupt happens, ring 1 change to ring 0,
			stack switch to sp0 in TSS.</para>
		<imageobject><imagedata fileref="res/proc_int.png"/></imageobject>
		<para>So every process need this special area,
			we define a struct called "stackframe_t".
			When a process runs,
			move the end address of the struct to sp0 in TSS.
			And when interrupt happens, stack swich to
			end of the "stackframe_t", push ip, cs and so on into it.</para>

	<sect1><title>Back To a Process From Interruption</title>
		<para>Prepare the stakframe, and instruction "iretd" will finish the job.
			Actually, our first process is running by this way,
			we prepare the process table, set esp to address of
			first process's stackframe, and "iretd".</para>
